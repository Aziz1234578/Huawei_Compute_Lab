# Huawei Cloud Lab – ECS Lifecycle & Image Management

This repository documents a hands-on lab conducted on the Huawei Cloud KooLabs platform. The objective was to work through the complete lifecycle of Elastic Cloud Servers (ECS), from initial provisioning to the creation and deployment of custom system images.

The content presented here is the result of an independent lab session and reflects personal practical experience with Huawei Cloud services.
